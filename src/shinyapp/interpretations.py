progression_interpretation_md = """\n\nThe *rally progression* reports describe the evolution of the rally across the completed stages. They provide a way of looking across all the  stage times, positions, in a single view.\n\nThe *overall position* line chart shows how each driver's overall position has evolved over the course of the rally. The chart shows increasing stage number from left to right, with a separate line reporting the position for each driver across stages.\n\n__Things to look for:__  if a line remains horizontal from one stage to another, the driver retained the same position. If the line slopes *up and to the right*. the driver imporved their position going from one stage to the next. If the line goes *down and to the right*, the driver has lost overall position."""

Gives an indication how how off the stage winnner each driver was.\n\n- __Stage diff (s)__: the *diff* is the time difference to the car ahead on stage. Gives an indication of how far off a driver was from improving their position.\n\n- __Stage chase (s)__: the *chase* is the time difference to the car behind. Gives an indication how threatened a driver was from the car behind.\n\n- __Overall rally time (s)__: the elapsed rally time by the end of a particular stage.\n\n- __Overall rally position__: the overall rally poisition by the end of a stage.

Gives an indication of how close they are to improving their overall rally position.\n\n- __Overall rally chase (s)__: in terms of overall rally time, how far a driver is from the car in the position behind. Gives an indication of how threatened a driver is by the car in the position behind."""
