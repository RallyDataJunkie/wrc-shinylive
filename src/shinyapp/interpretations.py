progression_interpretation_md = """\n\nThe *rally progression* reports describe the evolution of the rally across the completed stages. They provide a way of looking across all the  stage times, positions, in a single view.\n\nThe *overall position* line chart shows how each driver's overall position has evolved over the course of the rally. The chart shows increasing stage number from left to right, with a separate line reporting the position for each driver across stages.\n\n__Things to look for:__  if a line remains horizontal from one stage to another, the driver retained the same position. If the line slopes *up and to the right*. the driver imporved their position going from one stage to the next. If the line goes *down and to the right*, the driver has lost overall position."""
